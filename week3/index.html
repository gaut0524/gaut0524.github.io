                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Hong Kong, where I was caught up in the hustle and bustle of the city. I picked my career accordingly, but something always felt amiss. I have always dreamed of owning a coffee shop, but I had to give up that dream in order to live comfortably in my city. But now that I've moved to Canada and have established myself in the business world, I want to finally pursue my childhood dreams. 
                    </p>

                        I hardly consider this a job; this is more like a passion project. When I think about it, I realize how fortunate I am to be brewing coffee, tea, wonderful, caffeinated concoctions, and delicate, aromatic teas. It also doesn't hurt to be running a business alongside my daughter. She bakes and I brew, and it's a great system if I do say so myself. 

                        My favourite part of the job would have to be the customers. Old and young, new and regularâ€”through serving them, we catch a glimpse into their lives. I consider our store a harbour for people from all walks of life. And ultimately, as long as my coffee shop can bring them a modicum of joy or relief, then I'd say my job is well worth it.
                        What is my favourite quote? Well, it'd have to be: 
                        <em>"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says I'm possible."</em>
