                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Hong Kong, where I was caught up in the hustle and bustle of the city. I picked my career accordingly, but something always felt amiss. I have always dreamed of owning a coffee shop, but I had to give up that dream in order to live comfortably in my city. But now that I've moved to Canada and have established myself in the business world, I want to finally pursue my childhood dreams. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       

                        I hardly consider this a job; this is more like a passion project. When I think about it, I realize how fortunate I am to be brewing coffee, tea, wonderful, caffeinated concoctions, and delicate, aromatic teas. It also doesn't hurt to be running a business alongside my daughter. She bakes and I brew, and it's a great system if I do say so myself. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What's my favourite quote? Well, it'd have to be: 
                        <br>
                        "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says I'm possible." <cite>- Audrey Hepburn</cite>

                    </p>

                <h2>Anita (head baker)</h2>
                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like my mother, I was born in Hong Kong too. I was raised there until the age of 11, when I moved here. I met some family members who were passionate about food after relocating to Ottawa. From there, I picked up some simple baking skills and occasionally assisted them in the kitchen. Even yet, my love for baking was still in its infancy. It wasn't until my 17<sup>th</sup> year that I started to experiment with recipes and cook on my own. Once I started my culinary journey, I couldn't stop. I frequently prepared meals for my family, friends, and neighbours, and I realized baking held a special place in my heart. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When my mother sat me down and told me about her coffee-shop dream I was taken aback. She had never expressed  <em>any</em> interest, much less talked about this to any degree. But then she asked me to be her baker, and without so much as a second thought I replied yes. Thus, our journey began. Like any business we encountered challenges, but I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. I spend all day doing what I love, surrounded by the people I love. 
                       
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My favourite part of the job would have to be the customers. Old and young, new and regularâ€”through serving them, we catch a glimpse into their lives. I consider our store a harbour for people from all walks of life. And ultimately, as long as my coffee shop can bring them a modicum of joy or relief, then I'd say my job is well worth it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If I had to pick my favourite quote, I'd choose: 
                        <br>
                        "Faithless is he who says farewell when the road darkens." <cite>- J.R.R Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring</cite>
